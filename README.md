# ðŸ“° Fake-New-Detection
This project is a machine learning web application built with **Streamlit** that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real**. It uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on the widely-used `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` datasets.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Loads real and fake news datasets.
2. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and TF-IDF vectorization.
3. **Training**: Trains a Logistic Regression classifier.
4. **Saving**: Saves the model and vectorizer using `joblib`.
5. **Prediction**: Users can input news articles into the web app to classify them.
